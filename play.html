    <h4>Two	Gentlemen	of	Verona

    </h4>
    <h5>SCENE I. Verona. An open place.

    </h5>
    <p class="stage-direction">Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS
    </p>
    <h6 class="name valentine"> VALENTINE</h6>

   <p class="speech">Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
    Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
    Were't not affection chains thy tender days
    To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
    I rather would entreat thy company
    To see the wonders of the world abroad,
    Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
    Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
    But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
    Even as I would when I to love begin.</p>
    <h6 class="name proteus">PROTEUS</h6>
    <P class="speech">Wilt thou be gone? Sweet , adieu!
    Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
    Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
    Wish me partaker in thy happiness
    When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
    If ever danger do environ thee,
    Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
    For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</P>
   <h6 class="name valentine"> VALENTINE</h6>
   <p class="speech">And on a love-book pray for my success?
    PROTEUS
    Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.</p>
   <h6 class="name valentine"> VALENTINE </h6>
    <p class="speech">That's on some shallow story of deep love:
    How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.</p>
    <h6 class="name proteus">PROTEUS</h6>
    <p class="speech">That's a deep story of a deeper love:
    For he was more than over shoes in love.</p>
    <h6 class="name valentine">VALENTINE</h6>
    <p class="speech">'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
    And yet you never swum the Hellespont.</p>
   <h6 class="name proteus"> PROTEUS</h6>
   <p class="speech"> Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.</p>
   <h6 class="name valentine"> VALENTINE</h6>
    <p class="speech">No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</p>
    </h6 class="name proteus">PROTEUS</h6>
   <p class="speech"> What?</p>
    <h6 class="name valentine">VALENTINE</h6>
    <p class="speech">To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
    Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
    With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
    If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
    If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
    However, but a folly bought with wit,
    Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</p>
    <h6 class="name proteus">PROTEUS</h6>
    <p class="speech">So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</p>
    <h6 class="name valentine">VALENTINE</h6>
    <p class="speech">So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.</p>
    <h6 class="name proteus">PROTEUS</h6>
    <p class="speech">'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.</p>
    <h6 class="name valentine">VALENTINE</h6>
    <p class="speech">Love is your master, for he masters you:
    And he that is so yoked by a fool,
    Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.</p>
   <h6 class="name proteus"> PROTEUS</h6>
    <p class="speech">Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
    The eating canker dwells, so eating love
    Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</p>
    <h6 class="name valentine">VALENTINE</h6>
    <p class="speech">And writers say, as the most forward bud
    Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
    Even so by love the young and tender wit
    Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
    Losing his verdure even in the prime
    And all the fair effects of future hopes.
    But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
    That art a votary to fond desire?
    Once more adieu! my father at the road
    Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.</p>
   <h6 class="name proteus"> PROTEUS</h6>
    <p class="speech">And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</p>
    <h6 class="name valentine">VALENTINE</h6>
   <p class="speech"> Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
    To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
    Of thy success in love, and what news else
    Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
    And likewise will visit thee with mine.</p>
    <h6 class="name proteus">PROTEUS</h6>
    <p class="speech">All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!</p>
   <h6 class="name valentine"> VALENTINE</h6>
   <p class="speech"> As much to you at home! and so, farewell.
    Exit</p>
    
   <h6 class="name proteus"> PROTEUS</h6>
    <p class="speech">He after honour hunts, I after love:
    He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
    I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
    Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
    Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
    War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
    Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
    Enter</p>
     <h6 class="name speed">SPEED</h6>
     <p class="speech">Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?</p>
    <h6 class="name proteus">PROTEUS</h6>
   <p class="speech"> But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.</p>
    <h6 class="name speed">SPEED</h6>
    <p class="speech">Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
    And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.</p>
    <h6 class="name proteus">PROTEUS</h6>
    <p class="speech">Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
    An if the shepherd be a while away.</p>
    <h6 class="name speed">SPEED</h6>
    <p class="speech">You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,
    and I a sheep?</p>
    <h6 class="name proteus">PROTEUS</h6>
   <p class="speech"> I do.</p>
    <h6 class="name speed">SPEED</h6>
   <p class="speech"> Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.</p>
   <h6 class="name proteus" >PROTEUS</h6>
   <p class="speech"> A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.</p>
    <h6 class="name speed">SPEED</h6>
    <p class="speech">This proves me still a sheep.</p>
    <h6 class="name proteus">PROTEUS</h6>
    <p class="speech">True; and thy master a shepherd.</p>
    <h6 class="name speed">SPEED</h6>
    <p class="speech">Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.</p>
